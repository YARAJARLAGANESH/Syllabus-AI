# Syllabus-AI
Syllabus AI is a multi-agent system that converts raw curriculum PDFs/text into structured, chapter-wise syllabi. It uses Planner, Worker, and Evaluator agents to generate summaries, objectives, subtopics, MCQs, and resources, with session memory, context engineering, observability, and modular LLM support.
