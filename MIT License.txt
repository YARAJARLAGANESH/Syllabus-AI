# Syllabus AI

Syllabus AI is a multi-agent system designed to convert raw or unstructured
college syllabus text into a clean, structured, chapter-wise academic syllabus.

The system uses three custom agents:
- **Planner Agent** – detects chapters and creates task plan.
- **Worker Agent** – generates summaries, learning objectives, subtopics, MCQs, and resources using a pluggable LLM (stub or real).
- **Evaluator Agent** – rates output quality and flags issues.

The provided notebook `updated_multi_agent_syllabus_generator.ipynb` builds the
entire project structure, runs the agent pipeline, and supports upgrading to any
LLM provider. It outputs JSON results and allows exporting clean human-readable
PDF syllabus reports.

### Features
- Modular multi-agent architecture  
- LLM-pluggable Worker (stub + real provider ready)  
- Automatic chapter detection  
- Summary / Objectives / Subtopics / MCQs generation  
- Evaluation scoring  
- PDF export  
- Clean folder architecture for production upgrades  

This project serves as a foundation for building AI-powered academic tools,
automated curriculum processors, and college learning-assist platforms.
